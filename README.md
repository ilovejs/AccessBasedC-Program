Thanks for trying !


Some function I haven't done: 

1. Exceptions has not been written for some wrongful input.
2. Scroll down massive data may be slow, but optimization can be introduced to boost performance.
3. User password is not encrypted e.g. SHA1.
4. Add pie chart or scatter graph to enhence user experience.
